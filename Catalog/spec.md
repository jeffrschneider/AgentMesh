# Catalog Service Functional Requirements

- The Catalog Service maintains a registry of all AI agents available in the AgentMesh network.
- Agents are registered with metadata including: agent ID, name, mission, capabilities (e.g., "web search," "idea generation"), owner, description, inputs/outputs, and sample interactions. (Modified: Added description, inputs/outputs, sample interactions from List 2)
- The service allows agents or agent owners to add new agents to the catalog via a submission API.
- Agents can be removed from the catalog by their owner or an authorized admin agent through a deletion API.
- The Catalog Service provides a search function to find agents by keywords, categories, tags, capabilities, or use case (e.g., "data analysis for healthcare"). (Modified: Added categories, tags, use case from Lists 1 and 2)
- Agents can query the catalog to discover other agents based on specific capabilities or roles (e.g., "Find me a data analysis agent").
- The service returns agent details in a JSON format (e.g., { "agent_id": "A1", "name": "Ideator", "mission": "Generate ideas", "description": "...", "capabilities": [...], "sample_prompts": [...] }) for all queries. (Modified: Expanded details per Lists 1 and 2)
- The catalog tracks the availability status of each agent (e.g., "active," "offline," "deprecated") and updates this in real-time.
- Agents can self-register by submitting their metadata to the catalog upon initialization, using the BaseAgent interface.
- The service supports filtering agents by reputation score (via Reputation Service integration), cost, or access level (e.g., free, paid, restricted). (Modified: Added cost/access level from List 1)
- The Catalog Service enables agents to update their own metadata (e.g., new capabilities, mission changes, or version updates) through an update API, maintaining a version history with changelogs. (Modified: Added version history from Lists 1 and 2)
- The catalog broadcasts notifications to subscribed agents when new agents are added, existing ones are modified/removed, or updates occur. (Modified: Expanded scope from List 2)
- The service provides a list of all active agents on request, sortable by name, mission, registration date, or usage metrics (e.g., activation frequency). (Modified: Added usage metrics from Lists 1 and 2)
- Agents can request a "recommended agents" list, where the catalog suggests peers based on mission alignment, frequent use, or user preferences (if provided via Front Door). (Modified: Added user preferences from List 1)
- The Catalog Service assigns a unique agent ID to each new agent during registration to ensure network-wide identification.
- The service logs all registration, update, and deletion events for traceability within the AgentMesh network.
- The catalog integrates with AI agent execution platforms, allowing agents to be deployed or activated directly from the catalog (e.g., via a "launch" API call). (New: From Lists 1 and 2)
- The service supports a favorites/bookmarking system, letting agents or users (via Front Door) save frequently used agents for quick access. (New: From Lists 1 and 2)
- The catalog provides sample prompts or templates for each agent to guide effective interaction (e.g., "Ask Ideator: 'Generate ideas for X'"). (New: From List 2)
- The service includes an agent comparison tool, enabling side-by-side evaluation of agents by capabilities, reputation, or usage stats. (New: From List 2)
- The catalog exposes APIs for developers or external systems to query, register, or interact with agents programmatically. (New: From Lists 1 and 2)
- The service assumes user account creation, orgs, passwords, and access control are managed by the Front Door UI/app, but provides agent-level permissions (e.g., "public," "org-only") for catalog access. (New: Clarifies assumption, adds agent permissions from List 2)
- The catalog accepts user feedback or issue reports about agents (e.g., "Agent X is slow"), storing them for owners or the Reputation Service. (New: From Lists 1 and 2)
