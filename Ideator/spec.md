# Ideator Specification

Overview
The Ideator is a modular component within the AgentMesh framework designed to autonomously generate creative, actionable, and contextually relevant ideas or hypotheses based on input data and predefined objectives. It operates as an agent that collaborates with other components (e.g., Planner, Executor, Evaluator) in the AgentMesh network to contribute to problem-solving workflows. The Ideator leverages a combination of heuristic reasoning, external data integration, and iterative refinement to produce outputs that can be consumed by downstream agents.

**Functional Requirements**
- **Input Processing**
  -Accepts structured or unstructured input data from other agents or external sources via the AgentMesh communication protocol (e.g., JSON payloads over WebSockets).

  - Supported input types:
    - Text (e.g., problem statements, user queries, prior agent outputs).
    - Context metadata (e.g., objectives, constraints, domain-specific parameters).
    - Optional: References to external resources (e.g., URLs, file paths).

Validates input for completeness and relevance, raising an error if critical data is missing (e.g., no objective specified).

- **Idea Generation**
- Generates a set of ideas, hypotheses, or solutions based on the input data and a configurable generation strategy.
- Supports multiple generation modes:
    - Divergent Mode: Produces a broad range of creative, exploratory ideas (e.g., brainstorming).
    - Convergent Mode: Refines ideas toward a specific goal or constraint set.
    - Hybrid Mode: Balances creativity and feasibility based on weighted parameters.
  - Incorporates domain-specific heuristics or templates if provided (e.g., "For scientific problems, hypothesize causal relationships").
  - Limits output to a configurable number of ideas (default: 5) to prevent overwhelming downstream agents.

- **External Data Integration**
  - Optionally queries external sources (e.g., web search, X posts) to enrich idea generation when instructed.
  - Uses AgentMeshâ€™s built-in tools (e.g., search APIs) to fetch relevant data.
  - Caches results locally to avoid redundant queries within a session.

- **Output Formatting**
- Produces structured output in a standardized format compatible with AgentMesh:

```
json

{
  "ideas": [
    {
      "id": "unique-idea-id",
      "description": "Textual description of the idea",
      "confidence": float, // 0.0 to 1.0, optional confidence score
      "metadata": {
        "mode": "divergent|convergent|hybrid",
        "source": "internal|external|mixed"
      }
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "status": "success|error",
  "error_message": "string, if applicable"
}
```

  - Ensures ideas are concise (e.g., max 200 words per description) unless otherwise configured.

- **Collaboration**
  - Publishes generated ideas to the AgentMesh message bus for consumption by other agents (e.g., Evaluator, Planner).
  - Subscribes to feedback from downstream agents (e.g., "Idea X is infeasible") to refine future outputs.
  - Supports asynchronous operation, allowing it to process inputs and generate ideas independently of real-time agent interactions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Generates initial set of ideas within 5 seconds for inputs under 500 words (assuming standard hardware: 16GB RAM, 8-core CPU).
- Scales linearly with input size beyond 500 words.

**Extensibility**
- Allows custom generation strategies to be plugged in via a modular interface (e.g., Python class inheritance).
- Supports configuration of parameters (e.g., max ideas, verbosity) via a config file or runtime arguments.

**Reliability**
- Handles malformed inputs gracefully, returning an error message in the output rather than crashing.
- Logs all operations (inputs, outputs, errors) to a configurable log sink (e.g., file, console).

**Interface Definition**
Core Methods

initialize(config: Dict): Sets up the Ideator with configuration parameters (e.g., mode, max ideas, external data sources).

generate_ideas(input_data: Dict) -> Dict: Processes input and returns a structured set of ideas.

refine_ideas(feedback: Dict) -> Dict: Updates internal state and regenerates ideas based on feedback from other agents.

Event Handlers
on_message(message: Dict): Handles incoming messages from the AgentMesh bus (e.g., new input, feedback).

on_error(error: Exception): Logs and reports errors to the framework.

Configuration
Stored in a JSON file (e.g., ideator_config.json) or passed as runtime arguments:
json

```
{
  "mode": "hybrid",
  "max_ideas": 5,
  "external_search_enabled": true,
  "search_timeout_seconds": 10,
  "heuristics": ["causal_hypothesis", "iterative_refinement"],
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

**Dependencies**
Internal: AgentMesh communication library (e.g., WebSocket client).

**External: **
Web search API (e.g., via xAI-provided tools).
Optional: NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, transformers) for advanced text processing.

**Example Workflow**
The Planner sends a problem statement: "How can we reduce energy consumption in urban areas?"

The Ideator receives the input, validates it, and runs in hybrid mode.

It generates ideas:
"Install smart thermostats in all public buildings (confidence: 0.85)."
"Promote rooftop solar panels with tax incentives (confidence: 0.90)."
"Use AI to optimize traffic light timing (confidence: 0.75)."

The output is published to the AgentMesh bus.
The Evaluator provides feedback: "Smart thermostats are cost-prohibitive in older buildings."
The Ideator refines its output, replacing the thermostat idea with a new one.

**Constraints**
Does not generate images.
